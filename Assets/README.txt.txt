This Unity project contains my whole academic collection of Unity HLSL shaders.
A majority of these shaders were compiled by me during my CS320 Graphics Programming class at Kettering University.

You can find my shaders in the "MyShaders" folder and "MyShaders > ShaderGraph" directory.

If you are looking for the test scene shown in the picture on GitHub, it's the "SG_Samples"
located in "MyShaders > ShaderGraph > SG_Samples".

Enjoy and have a look around!
